## Prerequisites
1. Create a repository on your GitHub account.
   - Organize each solution in a separate folder, with 3-4 files per solution. Each file should contain one solution.
   
2. Implement solutions using JavaScript.
3. Push the solutions to your GitHub repository.
4. Submit the repository link for grading.
5. Ensure your repository includes a well-written README.

**NOTE**: Complete ALL challenges.

## Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks between 0 and 100. The function should output the corresponding grade:
- A > 79
- B - 60 to 79
- C - 50 to 59
- D - 40 to 49
- E - less than 40

Ensure the function handles edge cases appropriately (e.g., exactly 40, 49, 59).

## Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input. If the speed is less than 70 km/h, print "Ok". For every 5 km/h above 70, give the driver one demerit point and print the total points. If the points exceed 12, print "License suspended".
